- Ruby >= 1.9.2p290, not tested with other versions
- Node.js >= 0.5.6; the binary is expected to be located at /usr/local/bin/node

- Run "ruby main.rb add.loop" to compile and execute "add.loop". The same goes for the other examples. 
- The result of a computation will always be located in variable "xa".
